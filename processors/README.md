# Processor Integration

For this exercise you'll be implementing a Processor connection using Stripe.
We've provided you with an API Key for our sandbox account.

Take a look in `Stripe.ts`, you'll find 3 methods to implement; to authorize, capture and cancel a transaction.

To run the program use the following command:

```bash
yarn start:processors
```
